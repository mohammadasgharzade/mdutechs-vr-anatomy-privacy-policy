Privacy Policy for Mdutechs-VR-anatomy
Last Updated: November 19, 2025
1. Introduction
Welcome to Mdutechs-VR-anatomy ("we," "our," or "us"), a Canadian organization operating globally. We are committed to protecting your privacy while providing an immersive educational anatomy experience in Virtual Reality.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our application on Meta Quest devices. By using Mdutechs-VR-anatomy, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
2. Information We Collect
To provide our AI-driven tutoring and collect user feedback, we collect specific types of data:
A. Voice & Audio Data (Critical)
Our application uses voice recognition for two features: the AI Tutor (educational Q&A) and the AI Interviewer (post-session feedback).
•	What we collect: When you speak to the AI, your voice audio is processed solely to convert it into text.
•	How it is processed: Audio data is sent to our third-party AI processing providers (e.g., OpenAI, Microsoft Azure) solely for the purpose of transcription and generating a response.
•	Storage: We do not store your raw audio recordings after the request is processed. We retain only the text transcript of your study questions and your interview answers to analyze feedback and improve the curriculum (for the retention period specified in Section 6).
B. Usage & Gameplay Data
We collect anonymous data on how you interact with the app to improve the curriculum:
•	Which anatomical regions you visit (e.g., "Upper Limb," "Digestive System").
•	Duration of sessions.
•	Tutorial completion status.
•	System settings (Language preference, Nomenclature mode).
•	Analytics & Cookies: We use Google Firebase Analytics to monitor app performance, user engagement, and crash reporting. This service may use cookies or unique device identifiers (such as the Android Advertising ID or Instance IDs) to collect anonymous usage statistics.
o	Opt-Out: You may opt out of analytics collection via your device settings or specific app preferences where available.
C. Device Information
We collect technical data to ensure the app runs smoothly:
•	Headset model (e.g., Meta Quest 3, Quest 3S).
•	System language.
•	Crash reports and performance logs.
D. Meta Platform Data
Please note that Meta Platforms Technologies (Facebook) collects its own data regarding your headset usage, movement, and system interactions through the Horizon OS. This collection is governed by Meta's own Privacy Policy and is outside of our control.
3. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR & PIPEDA)
We comply with both the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for EU users and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) for Canadian users.
•	Performance of a Contract: We process your requests (Voice Data) to provide the core educational service you have requested (the AI Tutor).
•	Legitimate Interests: We process Usage Data and Interview Transcripts to improve our medical curriculum, fix bugs, and ensure the app functions correctly.
•	Consent (GDPR & PIPEDA): By enabling microphone permissions and engaging with the Voice features, you give explicit consent for us to process your audio for that specific session. You may withdraw this consent at any time by muting the microphone or revoking permissions in the Meta Quest settings. Note: Withdrawing consent does not affect data already processed; it only prevents future processing.
4. How We Use Your Information
We use the collected data for the following purposes:
1.	To Provide the Service: Enabling the interactive 3D anatomy models and AI responses.
2.	To Improve the Curriculum: Analyzing transcripts of user feedback (from the AI Interviewer) to identify requested features or confusing anatomy sections.
3.	To Fix Bugs: Using crash reports to stabilize the app.
4.	Language Preferences: To serve content in your selected language.
5. AI and Third-Party Data Processing
To deliver real-time answers, we utilize third-party AI services.
•	Data Transfer: When you ask a question or answer an interview question, the text of your input is sent to our AI partners (currently including OpenAI and/or Microsoft Azure).
•	No Personal Identifiers: We do not send your name, IP address, or personal Meta ID to the AI provider. Only the anatomy-related content is transmitted.
•	User Responsibility (Sensitive Data): Please do not share Protected Health Information (PHI), real patient names, or specific medical case details in your queries. The AI is intended for theoretical study only, and transcripts may be retained for product improvement.
•	Data Location & International Transfers:
o	Primary Storage: Your personal data and study history are primarily stored on servers located within the European Union (EU).
o	Canadian Operations: As a Canadian-European entity, administrative access to data may occur from Canada. The European Commission recognizes Canada as providing an adequate level of data protection, ensuring seamless and legal data handling.
o	AI Processing (US): Regarding AI features, specific text queries may be processed by our AI partners (OpenAI/Microsoft Azure) on servers that may be located in the United States. We ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable privacy laws including GDPR, PIPEDA, and CCPA, and that our third-party providers adhere to strict data protection standards and standard contractual clauses.
•	Medical Disclaimer: The AI Tutor is for educational purposes only and is not a replacement for professional medical consultation or advice. Do not rely on the AI Tutor for any real patient care, diagnosis, or treatment. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.
6. Data Retention
•	Audio: Deleted immediately after processing (transcription).
•	Transcripts: Retained for 12 months for product improvement and feedback analysis. After this period, data is either deleted or permanently anonymized for statistical analysis.
•	Account Data: If you choose to create an optional account, data (email, username, logs) is retained as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services.
•	Legal Exception: We may retain personal data for longer periods if required to comply with specific legal or regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.
7. Data Security
We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This includes using encryption (SSL/TLS) during data transit between your device and our EU-based servers or AI providers.
8. Your Rights (GDPR, PIPEDA & CCPA)
You have the right to control your data under European, Canadian, and Californian laws. You may:
•	Request Access: Ask for a copy of the data we have collected about you.
•	Request Deletion: You can request the deletion of your user data and chat transcripts by contacting us.
•	Data Portability: You have the right to request a copy of your data in a structured, machine-readable format.
•	Opt-Out: You may choose not to use the Voice features and rely solely on visual exploration (though this limits the app's functionality).
To exercise these rights, please contact us at: info@medutechs.eu
9. Children’s Privacy
Our application is intended for general users, medical students, and professionals. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13 (or under 16 in certain EEA jurisdictions without parental consent). If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under the relevant age limit without parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.
10. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. Significant changes may be communicated through an in-app notification and/or via email if you have registered an account.
